## 2026-08-06 — Make batch contention coverage scheduler-independent

The batch-admission contention test now injects the typed `contended` lease result directly instead
of depending on 40–120 ms renewal timing. The real renewable-lease behavior remains covered in
`admission-lease.test.ts`; this test is responsible only for proving that a contended acquisition
defers the entire suspended batch without mutating records.

Keep this separation when refactoring admission tests. Reintroducing wall-clock lease expiry into
the batch policy test makes the Windows CI result depend on scheduler pauses rather than behavior.
