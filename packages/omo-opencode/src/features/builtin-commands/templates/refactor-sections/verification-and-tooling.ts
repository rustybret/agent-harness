**Mark phase-6 as in_progress.**

## 6.1: Full Test Suite

\`\`\`bash
# Run complete test suite
bun test  # or npm test, pytest, go test, etc.
\`\`\`

## 6.2: Type Check

\`\`\`bash
# Full type check
tsc --noEmit  # or equivalent
\`\`\`

## 6.3: Lint Check

\`\`\`bash
# Run linter
eslint .  # or equivalent
\`\`\`

## 6.4: Build Verification (if applicable)

\`\`\`bash
# Ensure build still works
bun run build  # or npm run build, etc.
\`\`\`

## 6.5: Final Diagnostics

\`\`\`typescript
// Check all changed files
for (file of changedFiles) {
  aft_inspect({ scope: file })  // Must all be clean
}
\`\`\`

## 6.6: Generate Summary

\`\`\`markdown
## Refactoring Complete

### What Changed
- [List of changes made]

### Files Modified
- \`path/to/file.ts\` - [what changed]
- \`path/to/file2.ts\` - [what changed]

### Verification Results
- Tests: PASSED (X/Y passing)
- Type Check: CLEAN
- Lint: CLEAN
- Build: SUCCESS

### No Regressions Detected
All existing tests pass. No new errors introduced.

**Mark phase-6 as completed.**

# CRITICAL RULES

## NEVER DO
- Skip aft_inspect check after changes
- Proceed with failing tests
- Make changes without understanding impact
- Use \`as any\`, \`@ts-ignore\`, \`@ts-expect-error\`
- Delete tests to make them pass
- Commit broken code
- Refactor without understanding existing patterns

## ALWAYS DO
- Understand before changing
- Preview structural rewrites before applying them
- Verify after every change
- Follow existing codebase patterns
- Keep todos updated in real-time
- Commit at logical checkpoints
- Report issues immediately

## ABORT CONDITIONS
If any of these occur, **STOP and consult user**:
- Test coverage is zero for target code
- Changes would break public API
- Refactoring scope is unclear
- 3 consecutive verification failures
- User-defined constraints violated

# Tool Usage Philosophy

You already know these tools. Use them intelligently:

## AFT Navigation & Verification Tools
Leverage the AFT toolset for precision analysis. Key patterns:
- **Understand before changing**: \`aft_zoom(callgraph=true)\` to read a symbol with its calls-out/called-by, or \`aft_outline\` to grasp file/module structure
- **Impact analysis**: \`aft_callgraph(op="impact")\` to map all usages and blast radius before modification
- **Safe refactoring**: \`aft_refactor\` for cross-file symbol moves/extract/inline. AFT has no dedicated in-place rename op — for in-place symbol renames, verify current LSP tool availability rather than assuming a rename tool exists
- **Continuous verification**: \`aft_inspect\` after every change

## AST-Grep
Use the \`ast-grep\` skill helper or \`sg\` CLI for structural transformations.
**Critical**: Always preview first, review, then execute.

## Agents
- \`explore\`: Parallel codebase pattern discovery
- \`plan\`: Detailed refactoring plan generation
- \`oracle\`: Read-only consultation for complex architectural decisions and debugging
- \`librarian\`: **Use proactively** when encountering deprecated methods or library migration tasks. Query official docs and OSS examples for modern replacements.

## Deprecated Code & Library Migration
When you encounter deprecated methods/APIs during refactoring:
1. Fire \`librarian\` to find the recommended modern alternative
2. **DO NOT auto-upgrade to latest version** unless user explicitly requests migration
3. If user requests library migration, use \`librarian\` to fetch latest API docs before making changes

**Remember: Refactoring without tests is reckless. Refactoring without understanding is destructive. This command ensures you do neither.**
